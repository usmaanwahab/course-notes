Research is a focus investigation, guided by research questions. It involves a systematic process of gathering **evidence** to test **hypotheses**. It is also about collecting and analysing data in order to understand something of interest.

There are four key questions.

What do we want to achieve?
- Find out what is happening
- Develop something that works
- Evaluate a system or technology
- Compare systems
- Change human behaviour

Where does the data come from?
- How to collect data?
	- Read, observe, ask, measure, experiment, model, simulate, or mathematical proof
- Where to collect data?
	- Field, lab, conceptual, theoretical

What do we do with the data?
- Identify themes/patterns/quotes etc
- Calculate statistics
- Identify trends
- Create frameworks or taxonomies

Have we achieved our goal?
- Draw conclusions
- Evaluate results
- Identify limitations

A science is the process of systematically studying something, to identify a reasonable explanation for it. Collectively and over time, science gains knowledge that adds to an accurate representation of the world.

The **scientific method** is a philosophical framework for "doing science". That is a method free from **bias** and **prejudice**. It involves an iterative and systematic approach which involves
- Collecting evidence from experiments
- Empirically testing our beliefs against data
- Aiming for valid conclusions and reasonable explanations

**Inference** is a conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
**Scientific inference** is the process of reaching conclusions based on available evidence and theories. That is, we have one (or more) premise, from which we draw a conclusion.

**Deductive** inference - An inference is deductive if there is a relation between the premises and the conclusion guarantees the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true. If the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.

**Inductive** inference - An inference is inductive if we use premises about some observed objects to draw conclusions about similar unobserved objects. This implies that true premises can yield a false conclusion.

We tend to use inductive inference in research, we cannot test every possible input combination, we cannot evaluate with every person, we cannot test on every architecture, etc. Thus, we observe a **sample** to draw conclusion about a **population**.

However, when we use inductive inference, we assume the uniformity of nature. That is, we assume unobserved objects are the same as the observed objects. However, David Hume argues that induction cannot be rationally justified.

Inference to the best explanation, allows to draw the **most plausible** conclusion form the observations. Similar to inductive inference, both are non-deductive.

How do we determine the "best explanation"?
**Occam's Razor** - "More things should not be used than are necessary". Essentially, the most likely explanation for an occurrence is the most parsimonious - the simplest, requiring the least speculation, assumptions or premises.

A common research goal is to explain what causes something.
- Why is the text entry poor on touchscreens?
- Why is this set of instructions slow on this architecture?

**Causal Inference** is using inference to reason about the **cause** of something.
We can detect that something has happened, but cannot directly observe it actually happening.

**Correlation** does not imply causation, observing a **correlation** between $X$ and $Y$ does not mean $X$ causes $Y$.

To prevent this common pitfall, we use **controlled** experiments designs that support causal inference. We can control the effects of other factors through experiment design.

Scientific control tries to isolate the effect of our factor of interest. We compare **treatment** to the **control** (or **baseline**). If there's a difference between treatment and control, we can more safely infer that the treatment is the cause of the difference.

A **hypothesis** is a specific and testable explanation for a phenomena.
- specific - explains what you expect to happen in a certain circumstance
- predictive - makes a prediction that can be empirically tested
- testable - is falsifiable (can be dis-proven by empirical data)
- parsimonious - is as simple as feasible 

A hypothesis attempts to explain an observation that cannot be described. An informed guess about the cause of the phenomena. Allows predictions about unobserved entities. Predictions are tested against empirical data from experiments.

A **theory** however, is a hypothesis **proven** by testing, whereas a **hypothesis** is a testable prediction.

**Experiments** gather empirical data to test hypotheses against. If we want to make valid use of inference, we need to use carefully controlled experiments. They are for gathering data against which we can test our hypotheses.

**Inferential Statistical Analysis** often used to test hypotheses.
