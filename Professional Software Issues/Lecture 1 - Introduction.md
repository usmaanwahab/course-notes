Computing Legislation
- Aim to explore the most important legislation for IT
- Exploring both laws and cases
- Focus areas will be
	- Computer Crime - Computer Misuse Act 1990
	- Social Media and Online Safety - Online Safety Act 2023
	- Copyright Issues - Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1998
	- Data Protection - Data Protection Act 2018
- Understand as a computer scientist what and how tech legislation affects practice.

Computing Ethics
Computing is having a global impact. It is beyond the introduction stage, now at the permeation stage as computers have become integrated into every day life. 
It is important to discuss how ethics guide us with changes. Moor believes we can use **reason and relativity** in computer ethics he disagrees with the ideas of **Routine Ethics** and **Cultural Relativism**.

Computing has permeated all aspects of our lives, it enables us to do new things and raises many ethical question.

**Routing Ethics** is the idea that ethical problem in computing are no different to those in other fields.

**Cultural Relativism** is the idea that local customs and laws determine what is right and wrong, as as computing crosses cultural boundaries the problems are intractable.

Moor, 1998 provides an alternative view that:
- routine ethics underestimates the unique ethical challenges that computing technology poses
- cultural relativism underestimates the stability of our core human values

There are three main properties that raise problems within computing.

**Logical Malleability** - computers can perform any activity that has inputs, outputs and connecting logical operations. This has infinite possibilities. It is also what makes computers revolutionary. Computers can be manipulated,
- **Syntactically** - can alter what a computer does by changing its program 
- **Semantically** - can use states of a computer to represent anything one chooses - stock market sales to aircraft trajectories.
Computer are **general purpose machines**.

**Invisibility Factor** - Most of the time and under most conditions computer operations are invisible (3 types: invisible abuse, invisible programming, invisible complex calculations). Invisible abuse - intentional use of the invisible operations of a computer to engage in unethical conduct (i.e. salami slicing case).
Invisible programming - values embedded into programs by programmer, unintentional or intentional (i.e. google).
Invisible complex calculation - computers are capable of calculations too complex for easy human inspection (i.e. decision-making software).

Computers are **informationally enriching**. They are used in a diverse range of activities. Only in places they are used to enhance capabilities and improve performance. 

Computerised activities often become informationalised, that is the processing of information becomes a crucial ingredient in the performing and understanding of the activities themselves. 

Ethics is not just a simple decision about right and wrong, it is a process that can involve:
- Analysis of the nature and social impact of computer technology
- Formulation and justification of policies for the ethical use of technology
We often encounter issues before doing either of the above.

Technology innovation moves quickly and is disseminated widely, often without an understanding of unintended consequences (often creating a policy vacuum).

Computing is not a "profession" in the same way as medicine, law, engineering. Professional bodies such as the BCS, ACM, IEEE aimt to provide education and guidelines to encourage professionalism in practice. Professionals require mastery of a body of knowledge and usually have a good deal of autonomy in their work. professionals require mastery of a body of knowledge and usually have a good deal of autonomy in their work. Professional have to take responsibility for their decision and their actions. How might that affect what you do in the workplace
