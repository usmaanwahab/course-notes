Your essay MUST include all of the following:

a. Introduction: Introduce the topic - what is it about, what are the broad issues and areas where there are conflicting views?

b. Ethical issues: Identify ethical issues and dilemmas. Discuss different perspectives on those issues and link them with different ethical viewpoints. Discuss how they may be mitigated.

c. Legal issues: Identify and discuss relevant legal statutes and cases. Generally, use UK law, but if you are discussing a global issue, it is ok to discuss the law from different countries. Where you mention non-UK law or cases, you must state where they come from.

d. Social issues: Identify and critically discuss relevant social and political issues and impacts, giving examples.

e. Conclusions: Critically summarise the main points of the argument and identify your perspective and conclusions.

f. References: Must be cited in the text as well as full details being listed at the end. Use either Harvard or numbered formatting.

g. Write in your own words. When you use ideas that come from your reading and research, give a reference. Only use small direct quotes; you should usually summarise rather than quote using points from your sources to support your arguments.
