1. Law is what is deemed as criminal which may or may not align with the ethics of individuals. Ethics are more a set of principles and ideals that you uphold like your own personal law. For example, pirating content is illegal but when a market becomes anti-consumer or morally ambiguous then I can find pirating ethical, or at least tolerable. Things that are legal would be the vague/arbitrary censoring of online content, but I would question its legitimacy as it is not well defined, and poorly enforced. Many argue that censoring of this scale is unethical.
2. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 is about unauthorised access to computer systems and data. The EU GDRP is about the standards for process and protection of personal data.
